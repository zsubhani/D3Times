          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks & Poverty, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>When looking at this particular dataset, there was some positive relation between the percentage of people in poverty and the percentage of people without health insurance. Although with a correlation coefficient of 0.52, the relationship is not strong.</p>

          <p>When reviewing the median household income versus the percentage of people who smoke, there was some negative relation. This means in general that the greater the median household income, the lower percentage of people that are smokers.</p>

          <p>Comparing median age and percentage of obese people, the correlation coefficient is almost exactly 0 so a linear relationship doesn't exist between the two. However when looking at the chart, the majority of the data points are between median age 34 and 42 with an obesity percentage greater than 26%. More than a quarter of people in the median age from this dataset are listed as obese, which is concerning from an overall health standpoint.</p>
